# Google_Landmark_Recognition
An image classfication project using machine learning.

This repository is our final project for Advanced Predictive Modeling
As part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at UT Austin

## Get started
1. Download the data files 'train.csv' from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset).
2. Set up in Google Colab for optimal downloading and training time.

Have a look at the [blog](https://danielstern20.medium.com/google-landmark-recognition-476deb6575ee) by our team to follow our journey. 

## Codes
The notebook **Final_version** consists of the code to
1. Prepare dataset
2. EDA
3. Downloading images
4. Processing downloaded images

The following scripts contain each of our models:
1. EfficientNet_Model
2. Inception_Model
3. resnet_modeling
